# Compendium of Wondrous Curios You Will Feel Compelled to Extrude for Your Home

Hiya hello hi what's the happs love. Here's some random garbage I saw fit to inflict upon our planet. Peruse the folders to peep these bad boys. I generally don't upload them on the big deal 3D prints sites, since they are a pain to use and don't give me much visibility, so this is the canonical source.

Contact me if you want the STL of other stuff you saw me make, but bear in mind if I don't share them there's probably a reason they're not fit wider distribution.

I'd love to see my prints in action. You can also send me dog gifs to <woof@aria.dog>.
